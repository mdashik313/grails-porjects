Normalization:
Dividing a large table into several small table(reduce redundancy, memory efficient, require more time to query if database is very large)

De-normalization:
Combining small tables into a single large table(redundant data, optimizes query time)

Table design:
Candidate key must be placed at beginning of the table.(optimize query time)
Meet with client and understand which columns is frequently accessed, consider them to make candidate key.
